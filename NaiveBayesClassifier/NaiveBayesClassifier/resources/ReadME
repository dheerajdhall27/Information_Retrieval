This Program is used to create a model for the NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER.
All the modelFiles and prediction files can be found in the resources folder associated with each Code base

1) NaiveBayesClassifier : Has model files for Laplace Smoothing
2) NaiveBayesClassifierExtraCreditSmoothing: Has model files for Dirichlet smoothing and Jelinek-Mercer smoothing
3) NaiveBayesClassifierExtraCreditFeatures: Has model files for Bigrams and smoothing related files

The Top 20 files are contained in the NaiveBayesClassifier resources folder



Unzip the folder Dheeraj_Kumar_Dhall_HW4.zip
This program was created in PyCharm using Python "3.7.4"
1) Make sure that the textcat file is present in the root directory
2) First step in running the program is to make sure that proper command line arguments are supplied.
   Run the nbTrain file first.
   a) If Running in PyCharm: Under RUN -> Edit Configuration -> setup these command line arguments
      1) "textcat/train" "resources/model.txt"
      2) This would create the model-file under the resources folder
   b) If Running using command prompt then supply the above as the command line arguments also make sure the folder
      structure is maintained.

3) After running the nbTrain.py the model file should be created in the resources folder.
4) To test the model use the nbTest file, which accepts the command line in this order.
   "resources/model-file.txt" "textcat/test" "predictions-file.txt" : For test data
   "resources/model-file.txt" "textcat/dev/pos" "predictions-file-dev.txt" : For dev data
5) nbTest classifies the dev data into positive or negative. It also produces the Top 20 words (NEG TO POS and POS TO NEG)
